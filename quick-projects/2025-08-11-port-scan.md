**Project Title:*Port Scan and Documentation  
**Date:**11aug2025  

**Category:**  
- [x] Networking  
- [ ] Security  
- [ ] Linux Basics  
- [ ] Practical IT  
- [ ] Other  

**Goal:**Scan open ports  
---

**Steps Taken:**  
1.Install nmap  
2.find router ip  
3.run nmap port scan  

---

**Commands & Tools Used:**
sudo install apr nmap 
ip route | grep default
nmap -sV 912.168.4.1
  
---

**Observations & Findings:**
996 closed TCP ports |
53/tcp    open  domain          (unknown banner: not currently available)
1900/tcp  open  http            Tornado httpd 6.1
3001/tcp  open  ssl/nessus?
10001/tcp open  ssl/scp-config?
  
---

**Outcome:**
I was able to install Nmap and scan my target successfully.
The scan found 4 open TCP ports:
-53(domain) - unknown barrier
-1900(http) - tornado httpd 6.1
-3001(ssl/nessus?) - possible Nessus service
-100011(ssl/scp-config?) - unknown service

996 TCP ports were closed.

**Next Steps / Improvements:** 
Check what is actually running on TCP port 53. It might be a DNS service,
but I'm not sure. I'll try scanning it more closely to see what program
is using it and what it does. I will also work on getting more knowledgeable in this process to cut my time down from 1 hour to under 20 minutes.
